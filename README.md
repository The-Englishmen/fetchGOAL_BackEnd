## MVP User Stories 

* As a user, I want to seee a listing of the current coach for my favorite club. 

* As a user, I want to be able to easliy navigate the fetchGOAL app on my mobile device so that I can see club details while i'I'm on the go.

* As a user, I would like to click on an indivilual club to view additional details about it including the current clubs starting formation, current coaching staff, and overall coaching staff records in current league.

* fetchGOAL is currently a fully functioning app with CRUD functionalitlty from the admin portal. 

## Post MVP Stretch GOALS

* As a user, I would like to securely login to the app and navigate as easily, and seemlessly as possiable. 

* As a user, I would like to filter through clubs to see their up coming matches, and current recored for the current season. 

* In the future, users that have signed up, and recall their login credentials, can customize their experience by removing/archiving a certain portain of the database as too obstruct it from the users view (in the untimily event that a user is fully against seeing a certain clubs logo! )
